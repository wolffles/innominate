# As a coach
## Set expectations
* what to expect clarifying goals
* format of meetings
* talk about confidentiality
* definition of success
* explain that the coachee needs to drive and lead the conversations
* explain that I'm not here to give answers but help self reflect and help uncover self solutions.
* difference between coach vs therapy is looking forward instead of the past. focus on growth. 


1st birthday coming up = coach
2nd birthday = coachee
3rd = observer
Coachee gets to choose the prompt
5 minutes to coach
2 minutes to debrief as a group
And then we rotate

* tell him I'm really getting into security and want to learn more about it.
* I'm really getting into the world of hacking listening to all the podcasts I can, and trying to find good resources on it. 
* help with personality enhancements
    - I'm not sure what I don't know and what I need to know. and so when I take on tasks I don't know how to ask for help.
    - confidence building,
    - communication,
    - people skills.
* address overwhelming fear that I'm not fitting in with the team from gap. not sure if its anxiety or if its actually true. 

# Feedback
* as a new person take a step back and look at the bigger picture even if it slows down the process, and your superpower is able to ask dumb questions without losing social creds.


* I've asked multiple people about their perspective on events, and it doesn't match up with my own experiences.
